# SOLAR SYSTEM ANIMATION PAGE

For a Digital Design course, I was required to create a webpage displaying some sort of animation. The catch: I was only allowed to use CSS for the animation.

As such, I created a simple Solar System webpage that had rotating planets. Additionally, if a user hovers over a planet, the planet comes into focus and facts about the planet appear. All animation is done with CSS.
Although the page is rough around the edges, I had fun creating a page related to my previous area of studides (Physics and Astronomy!)
